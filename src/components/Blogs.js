                            It's time we start working towards a world where everyone has access to sustainable menstrual hygiene products or â€œGreen menstruation. Vaginal and reproductive health friendly because their usage decreases the incidence of rashes, vaginal infections and drastically decreases the incidence of new age problems like endometriosis, adenomyosis, cervical cancer. These problems arise due to harmful chemicals in plastic pads i.e. dioxins and furans. And obviously environment friendly because these sustainable products produce only 0.6 percent of the waste as compared to single use plastic pads.
